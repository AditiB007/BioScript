instructions:
a = dispense 50 units of PCRMix
b = dispense 50 units of Buffer
PCR_Master_Mix = mix a with b

heat PCR_Master_Mix at 94c for 2m

repeat 20 times {
    heat PCR_Master_Mix at 94c for 20s
    heat PCR_Master_Mix at 50c for 40s
}

DNA_Sensor = detect fluorescence on PCR_Master_Mix for 30s

if (DNA_Sensor <= 85) {
    dispose PCR_Master_Mix
}

repeat 20 times {
    heat PCR_Master_Mix at 94c for 20s
    heat PCR_Master_Mix at 50c for 40s
}

heat PCR_Master_Mix at 70c for 5m
